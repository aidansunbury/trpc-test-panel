# Contributing

`trpc-ui` is open to contributions! Before getting started, check the open issues, or create a new one for bug fixes or feature improvements. @aidansunbury to be assigned to the issue.

It is also extremely helpful to upvote (üëç) or downvote (üëé) existing bugs and features, to ensure that the most in demand features or problematic bugs get addressed first.

## Repo Overview

There are three main packages in this repo:
1. `trpc-ui`: The main package that is [published to npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/trpc-ui)
2. `dev-app`: A development app that makes it easy to work on `trpc-ui` locally. It uses the `trpc-ui` package.
3. `test-app`: A [showcase application](https://trpc.aidansunbury.dev/) to demonstrate the capabilities of `trpc-ui`

The repo is configured to work with [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces). To install dependencies for all three packages, run:

```sh
pnpm install
```

When adding new dependencies, be sure to add them in the correct package, and not the top level `package.json`. Running `pnpm install` at the root will give a warning.

### Development App

Included in this repo there is a development app that makes it easy to work on `trpc-ui` locally. It is a `next.js` app that will render the router included in the dev app. To run it, do:

```sh
pnpm dev:dev-app # Run at base of monorepo
```

```sh
cd packages/dev-app && pnpm dev # To run in the dev-app directory
```

This will run the app in your browser.

To add / remove procedures from the dev app's panel, modify its router in [router.ts](./packages/dev-app/src/router.ts). Please do not commit changes to this file.

### Test App

The test app is just a simple express server. The procedures can be modified in the test-app [router.ts](./packages/test-app/src/router.ts) router. After adding new functionality to the trpc-ui package, be sure to showcase it in the test app!

```sh
pnpm dev:test-app # Run at base of monorepo
```

```sh
cd packages/test-app && pnpm dev # To run in the test-app directory
```

## Preview deployments
Most of the time, the Dev App will be sufficient for testing changes to the trpc-ui package. However, the Dev App does not actually use the bundled `trpc-ui` dependency the same way you would install it into your project. Additionally, the dev app is configured using the NextJS pages router and superjson, so it is not particularly for debugging issues specific to other [trpc adapters](https://trpc.io/docs/server/adapters) or issues that only arise when not using superjson.

As a result, this project is configured to use [preview releases](https://pkg.pr.new/), for each pull request. These preview releases can then be installed anywhere to test the changes made to the `trpc-ui`.

```
pnpm add https://pkg.pr.new/aidansunbury/trpc-ui@40
```

Comments like this will be automatically generated on each pull request.


## Front end contributions

The `trpc-ui` front end is just a bunch of react components. Any updates made to the react components should immediately be visible while running the `dev-app`.

The React components are located in `packages/trpc-ui/src/react-app`.

## Updating the parser

For more advanced features, it may be required to update the parsing logic, which can be found in `packages/trpc-ui/parse`.

### Running the parser tests

Jest is used to test the functionality of the parser. To run them, use

```sh
pnpm test:panel
```

at the root of the monorepo. If you add additional functionality to the parser, please add tests for the new functionality.

## Linting and Formatting

trpc-ui uses [biome](https://biomejs.dev/) as a linter and formatter. To just check for errors, run

```bash
pnpm biome:check
```

To fix them, run
```bash
pnpm biome:check:fix
```

both at the root of the monorepo. Not all errors can be fixed automatically.

There are a good number of errors in much of the older code, but please try not to introduce new ones.
